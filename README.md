# Squadron Personnel_Tracker
This program is a basic personnel tracker that can be used by a squadron exec or secretary to better manage unit personnel. It has 4 seperate microservices that each add functionality along with a navigation bar (created as its own mini React app) and a Spring back end. These components were brought together using Single-SPA. Single-SPA is a javascript router for front-end microservices. It allows for the mounting and unmounting multiple micro-front-ends. To demonstrate the advantages of using Single-SPA, we have a react microservice for the navigation bar that is mounted to all paths. When we route to each of the four microservices, they are mounted/unmounted according to the filepath/nav button. However, the nav bar stays for all of the 4 microservices.
